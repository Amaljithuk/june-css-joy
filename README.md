What I Built
I created a vibrant and interactive Pride Month landing page that celebrates love, diversity, and LGBTQ+ history. The page features:

Interactive CSS Art Pride Flag - A clickable animated Pride flag that triggers colorful fireworks when clicked
Dynamic Animations - Floating hearts, stars, and rainbow elements with hover effects throughout the page
Comprehensive History Section - Timeline covering the Stonewall Riots (1969), first Pride March (1970), and creation of the Rainbow Flag (1978)
Pride Colors Explanation - Interactive cards showing the meaning behind each color of the Pride flag
Community Section - Emphasis on love, unity, and pride with animated hover effects
Functional Call-to-Actions - "Learn More" button linking to Wikipedia's Pride Month page and "Get Involved" button connecting to a Pride Discord community
The design uses a modern gradient background, CSS animations, and responsive design principles to create an engaging, celebratory experience.
